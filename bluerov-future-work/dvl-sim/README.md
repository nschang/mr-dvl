# Work with DVL and BlueROV in a simulation environment

Moving the robot to and from the pool is quite some labour. Not having easy access to water suitable for testing is also a major hinderance in development of underwater robotics. Therefore, would be interesting to explore options to simulate the vehicle and environment input in a virtual environment. 

There are currently a few ways to do this: 

1. BlueSim, a tailored simulation package made by BlueRobotics. 

2. Gazebo

Some major fuss has been encountered when setting up the virtual environment (VirtualBox+Vagrant) on MacOSX, which is generally [not recommended](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-using-vagrant.html). Therefore, waiting to implement this on a newly ordered RPi-4, awaiting shipment...
